# dotfiles
this repo holds my dotfiles (and other config files).

### info
i have two main machines, and this repo's folder structure is adjusted according to them.

most files in this repo are related to **"gohan"**, a desktop running Arch Linux and the Fish shell which was gifted to me in mid-2021:

my Fish theme is a custom fork of [agnoster](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-agnoster) called [nullifidian](https://github.com/sporeball/nullifidian).

the [windows/](https://github.com/sporeball/dotfiles/tree/master/windows) folder contains files exclusive to **"DESKTOP"**, a somewhat old and decrepit laptop running Windows 10 and the Bash shell:

i don't use this one for programming very often anymore.

on both machines, i use [Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) as my terminal (formerly [Hyper](https://hyper.is) on DESKTOP), [snazzy](https://github.com/alebelcor/alacritty-snazzy) as my color set, and [vim](https://www.vim.org) as my editor.
